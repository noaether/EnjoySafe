# Folder Structure

Each folder represents a different part of the application. The folder structure is as follows:

```none
*name*.dart - This is the main file for the folder. It contains the main widget for the folder. Stateless
information.dart - This file contains information about alcohol and the effects of alcohol. Stateless
handler.dart - This file contains the logic for the folder (Like the calculator). Stateful
```
